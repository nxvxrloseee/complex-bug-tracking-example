## Project name "complex-bug-tracking-example"

## Project Objectives

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the practical application of basic programming and software development principles. The project includes:
- **Training**: Immersion in the development process, from writing code to documenting the project.
- **Functionality Demonstration**: Presentation of the program's core features, its robustness to bugs, and usability.
- **Skills Development**: Mastering the principles of modularity, exception handling, and organizing the project in a repository.

## Description of functionality

The project implements the following functionality:
- **Basic Operations**: Performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) through an interactive interface.
- **Error Processing**: Built-in mechanisms to handle incorrect data entry and exceptional situations (e.g. division by zero).
- **Interactivity**: The user can select the desired operation and enter data through the console, making the application simple and easy to learn.
- **Modularity**: Each operation is implemented in a separate function, making it easy to further support and scale the project.

## Operating Conditions

The following conditions must be met for the project to operate correctly:
- **Runtime Environment**: The project is designed to run in the Python 3.x environment. It is recommended to use the latest stable version of the Python interpreter.
- **Dependencies**: This project does not have any external dependencies that require installation. However, additional libraries may be added when further extending the functionality.
- **Access Rights**: All project files must have appropriate read and execute permissions. When used on servers or distributed systems, data protection and execution security must be ensured.
- **Startup Instructions**: To start the project, run the `python3 calc.py` command (or specify the correct path to the main file), then follow the instructions displayed.
- **Technical Support**: If you have any questions or errors, it is recommended that you consult the Python documentation or the instructions in the [Issues](https://github.com/nxvxrloseee/complex-bug-tracking-example/issues) section of this repository.
